# CiscoNotes

Notes for my Cisco Courses at TEC Ballerup. Everyone is free to contribute and correct mistakes in the notes.

# Contributing

There are three types of categories for the post items
  - Sheets (0000-01-01)
  - Labs (0000-02-02)
  - Notes (0000-03-03)

They all have a template located in `_drafts`, each prefixed with their respective date, as mentioned in the previous list.

## Sheets
These should contain brief information explicit to their respective topic. For instance, an EIGRP sheet should not have OSPF information in them, but how to setup a working EIGRP configuration, optionally debug and show commands as well.

## Labs
Their title should reflect the name on the Cisco Lab paper, and if the lab is known to have different versions please add this to the title as well, for instance `Setup Lab 2 2 EIGRP Load Balancing (v1.1)`

## Notes
These are loose notes that should match semesters within cisco, for instance `ICND1` or `CCNAS`. It should contain almost everyone command used for that specific semester.
